Make idnum tables from itemInfo:
1)Copy itemInfo.lub to "SeperateItemInfo" Folder, If you have .lua, just change the extension to .lub
2)If you have lua installed, just double-click "SeperateItemInfo.lua" and it will do the work.
3)If you don't have lua installed, just run Seperate.bat
4)The files will be stored in "idnum" folder.
Note: This can even convert the compiled .lub file to idnum table
